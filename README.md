Holiday Hero Core
=================

Provides the core functionality for the holiday hero app.
This is done to ensure that business logic is decoupled from the rest of the application.

This will also be an attempt at programming using TDD.

Functionality
-------------

The base of the system is to provide a user with the capabilities to manage gift giving and receiving.
There should also be a basic network so that one user can affect the giving and receiving they do of others.
The primary user should be able to accept or deny those changes though.
